# Starter Repo for Building Browser Libraries

> A quick starter for building a browser library without dealing with build systems.

1. Clone this repository and cd into the directory.
2. Run `npm install -g gulpjs/gulp#4.0; npm install;`
3. Run `gulp bp:dev`. This command starts the build system transforming the files
in the `src` directory to built artifacts in the `build` directory. The contents
of `build` and `example` directories will be served on
[http://localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

Check the gulpfile.js once you're ready to rename your project to something other
that "starter".
